Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project employs K-Means clustering to segment customers based on buying behavior, demographic data, and brand interaction. With the strength of unsupervised learning techniques, the model helps in identifying customer segments that are distinctive in nature and can be effectively targeted, resulting in improved customer interaction, increased sales, and focused marketing. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and application of K-Means and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA for efficient segmentation. Technologies employed are Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
